## [0.5.0] - 2023-12-27

This version requires a database migration and introduces breaking changes in the configuration file. Please read the [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) file for more information.

## Added
- Performance enhancements:
  - Messages are parsed only once and their offsets stored in the database, which avoids having to parse them on every `FETCH` request.
  - Background full-text indexing.
  - Optimization of database access functions.
- Storage layer improvements:
  - In addition to `FoundationDB` and `SQLite`, now it is also possible to use `RocksDB`, `PostgreSQL` and `mySQL` as a storage backend.
  - Blobs can now be stored in any of the supported data stores, it is no longer limited to the file system or S3/MinIO. 
  - Full-text searching con now be done internally or delegated to `ElasticSearch`.
  - Spam databases can now be stored in any of the supported data stores or `Redis`. It is no longer necessary to have an SQL server to use the spam filter.
- Internal directory: 
  - User account, groups and mailing lists can now be managed directly from Stalwart without the need of an external LDAP or SQL directory.
  - HTTP API to manage users, groups, domains and mailing lists.
- IMAP4rev1 `Recent` flag support, which improves compatibility with old IMAP clients.
- LDAP bind authentication, to support some LDAP servers such as `lldap` which do not expose the userPassword attribute.
- Messages marked a spam by the spam filter can now be automatically moved to the account's `Junk Mail` folder.
- Automatic creation of JMAP identities.
