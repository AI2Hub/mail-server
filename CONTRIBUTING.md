# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Stalwart Mail Server project! We appreciate your support and enthusiasm. This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Not accepting Pull Requests at this time
As of now, the Stalwart Mail Server project is in a phase of rapid development and evolution. Until we reach version 1.0, **we are not open to direct code contributions** in the form of pull requests. This is due to the following reasons:
- The project is undergoing significant changes which might make integrating external contributions challenging.
- Our current resources do not allow for the efficient evaluation and testing of submitted pull requests.

We understand that this might be disappointing, but rest assured, this measure is temporary and is aimed at maintaining the integrity and consistency of the project during its critical development phase.

## Other Ways to Contribute
While we're not accepting pull requests at this moment, there are several other valuable ways you can contribute to the Stalwart Mail Server project:

- **Enhancement Requests**: If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement, we encourage you to file an enhancement request on GitHub. This way, your idea can be evaluated and potentially included in future versions of the project. To do this, create a new issue on our GitHub repository and label it as an 'enhancement'.
- **Extensive Testing**: One of the most helpful contributions is to rigorously test the software in various environments and use-cases. Your testing can uncover important issues and help improve the stability of the project.
- **Writing Unit Tests**: Contributing new unit tests or improving existing ones is a great way to ensure the reliability and robustness of our codebase.
- **Reviewing Documentation**: As the project evolves, so does the need for accurate and up-to-date documentation. Reviewing, updating, or writing new documentation is a critical contribution that helps new and existing users understand and effectively use Stalwart Mail Server.

## Stay Updated
We anticipate opening up for code contributions once version 1.0 is launched. We recommend keeping an eye on our project announcements for any updates regarding contribution opportunities.
